            <p>Dear Yulli,</p>
            <p>Though our time together may have been short, the impact you've had on my life is unreal. In just three weeks, you've managed to fill my days with love, laughter, and an overwhelming sense of happiness.</p>
            <p>Despite the distance between us, you've shown me what it means to be loved. Your kindness, your compassion, and your unwavering support have been a constant source of comfort and strength, and for that, I am endlessly grateful.</p>
            <p>Yulli, you are a ray of sunshine in my life, and I am thankful every day for the chance to know you and to love you. Your smile brightens even the darkest of days, and your laughter is a melody that echoes in my heart.</p>
            <p>Our journey together may have just begun, but already, I find myself dreaming of a future filled with love, laughter, and countless adventures with you by my side.</p>
            <p>On this special day, I want you to know how much you mean to me. You are more than just my gf; you are my best friend, my confidante, and my soulmate. With you, I feel complete.</p>
            <p>Happy birthday, my dear Yulli. May this day be as beautiful and as special as you are, and may the coming year bring us even closer together, both in heart and in spirit.</p>
            <p>With all my love and just want you to know that you are perfect</p>
